            <p class="greenbold">Take a ride on the Rail Runner</p>
            <p>100 Rail Runner Dr.<br>Belen, NM 87002<br>Website: <a href="https://www.riometro.org/232/Train-Fares"
                    target="_blank">Railrunner Train Fares</a></p>
            <p>Built in 2006, the Rail Runner commuter train originally went from Belen to Bernalillo, just north of
                Albuquerque, with stops in Los Lunas, Isleta and Albuquerque. Later, it was extended all the way to
                Santa Fe. It soon became popular with college students and those who work in Albuquerque. Schools
                use it for field trips, and families use it for trips to the Albuquerque Bioparks, Old Town
                and museums, as the train station is within walking distance.</p>
            <p>Train fares depend on distance traveled, as there are several stops between Belen and Santa Fe. Single
                passes and monthly passes are available. See the website to purchase tickets and for further details.

                visit the gallery, you will need to book a viewing in advance. Due to COVID restrictions, only groups of

            <p>The Belen Harvey House operated from 1910 to 1939, and briefly reopened in the 1940's during World War 2
                to serve troop trains.In the 1950's it became a dormitory for railroad employees. That continued through
                the 1970's. These days it is a museum that hosts all kinds of events from quilting shows to the
                Christmas Bugg lights display (named after Norman Bugg who donated most of the displays after his
                enormous display became too much for him and his wife to handle in their golden years). Admission is
                free, but donations are accepted and welcome.Don't forget to sign the guest book! For more historical
                information, see <br><a

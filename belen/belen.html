            <h2>Belen, New Mexico. Established 1740</h2>
            <p>The city was originally named Nuestra Senora de Belen (Our Lady of Belen), and the Catholic Church in the
                center of town still bears this name. Belen means Bethlehem in Spanish. The town of Belen was named
                after the birthplace of Jesus due to the fact that the climate is similar to the climate of Palestine.
            </p>

            <p>The original cowby (vaquero) culture developed along the Rio Grande, which passes through Belen. It was
                brought here by colonists of Don Juan De OÃ±ate who arrived in 1598. The colonists were ranchers, and
                their way of life developed into what people now know as cowboys.</p>

            <p>Belen New Mexico was part of a 200,000 acre Spanish land grant (called the Rio Abajo, or lower river)
                from King Charles(Carlos) III of Spain on November 15, 1740 given to Captain Diego Torres. Descendants
                of Torres still reside in Belen. In 1740, Mexico was considered a colony of Spain, and New Mexico was
                part of Mexico. The land grant stretched from the Rio Puerco on the west side, to the Manzano mountains
                on the east side, from Tome and across the Rio Grande to Los Chavez on the north and down to the town
                of Bernardo on the south.</p>

            <img src="images/manzanos400.jpg" alt="View of the Manzano mountains east of Belen.">

            <P>The Camino Real (Royal Road) passes directly through Belen. The Camino Real was a trade route that
                stretched 1,590 miles between Mexico City and San Juan Pueblo in northern New Mexico. It has been deemed
                a historic landmark. Travelers can follow the historic road which is marked with information signs along
                the road. Highway 314 (which used to be highway 85) runs from South Belen to Albuquerque. The road signs
                can be found along this route. for more information, visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm"

            <p>After the Mexican-American war, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 the United States acquired much
                of the Southwest. Shortly thereafter, a variety of European families settled in Belen. Many of our
                streets around parks are named after the original settlers. There are German names like Becker, Dalies
                and Reinken, and French names like Feil and Didier.</p>

            <h3>Our Movie Industry</h3>
            <p>Belen's Old Western feel with our old hotels, Harvey House, tumbleweeds, trains and dust is a magnet for
                production companies looking to make movies. Belen has seen its fair share of celebrities in recent
                years. the Movie Industry keeps many Belenites employed and ranchers with horses, cattle, sheep and
                goats are in high demand. Extras can make up to $80 a day, as well. With Netflix moving into
                Albuquerque, Belen is becoming a well-known town for moviemakers. The most recent movie made in Belen
                was "Cry Macho", by Clint Eastwood.</p>

            <h3>Livelihoods</h3>
            <p class="owner">Farming</p>
            <p>Much of Belen is open space and rural. Because of this, farming is one of the things that sustains
                residents. Many people grow hay and alfalfa, which is bailed and sold to feed cattle and horses. There
                are also several small dairies in the area.</p>

            <p class="owner">Restaurants</p>
            <p>Belen has no shortage of family-owned restaurants. Most of them serve New Mexican food--the kind of
                Mexican food that can only be found in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. Central New Mexican food has a
                strong Native American influence, which comes with a flavor all its own.</p>

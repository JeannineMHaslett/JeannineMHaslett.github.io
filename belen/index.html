            <h2>About the Chamber of Commerce</h2>
            <p class="mini-heading">Our Purpose:</p>
            <p>Welcome to Belen (pronounced beh-len, emphasis on len).</p>
            <p>One of the most frequently asked questions in Belen is, "Red or green?" referring to how you
                prefer your chile. One of the second most frequently asked questions is, "What business does your family
                own?" That's because small family businesses make up most of the commerce in our city. Our goal is to
                provide a networking system of businesses that support other businesses. When businesses do well,
                everyone wins. The money you spend at a local restaurant is used to pay employees. Those employees go
                out into the community and purchase goods and services from other local businesses. Therefore, helping
                one business helps all businesses. The Belen Chamber of Commerce helps to promote businesses in Belen so
                our economy can be stronger. One example is our "Buy Local" campaign that promotes buying from a small,
                family-owned business instead of big, national, corporate stores.</p>

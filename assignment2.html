                    <a href="https://www.orientaltrading.com/" target="_blank"><br>Oriental Trading Company</a>

                    <p class="paragraph">Fitts' Law basically says that the longer it takes for a user to get
                        to the next button, the more likely you are to lose that customer because the
                        difficulty of finding the links he needs will lead him to give up.</p>
                    <p>Oriental Trading Company is very easy to use both on the laptop and the mobile divice.
                        Here, the mobile divice screen has a hamburger menu on the top left side that opens an easy
                        to navigate menu. After you have chosen the category and the product, the "Add to Cart" box
                        is very easy to find.</p><br>

                <h2>White Space and Clean Design
                    <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank"><br>Squarespace</a>
                </h2>
                <div><br>
                    <img src="images/squarespace1.jpg" alt="Squarespace Website home page"><br>

                    <p class="paragraph">Squarespace uses white space very well. In the top photo, ther is a photo
                        background. The Heading and paragraph aren't too close to each other, and there is plenty of
                        space around it. There is plenty of space around the button, and the image is off to the bottom
                        corner,
                        leaving lots of space in between items.</p>
                    <p>The middle photo has a little more content on it, but it still follows the same principles as the
                        top
                        one, then placing the photo at the very bottom of the page, which still leaves adequate room
                        between
                        the paragraphs and the images.</p>
                    <p>the last photo is basically an image on top of an image. It works because the iPhone is white,
                        isolating the
                        image on the phone and providing plenty of white space around it.</p>

                </h2>
                <div>

                    <p class="paragraph">Contrast Rebellion is a website about contrast. It does an excellent job of
                        showing the viewer
                        what good contrast looks like. the first photo has a black and gray image on a white background.
                        Those colors always
                        contrast well. The construction-site orange button also shows up well against the white.</p>
                    <p>The second photo is a light, yellow-green color. Usually, white words wouldn't work on such a
                        light background,
                        but there is a black drop-shadow around the letters that contrast with the green, making the
                        white letters pop.
                        The black text contrasts well with the green, and that same orange button has plenty of contrast
                        without vibrating.</p>
                    <p>The last photo is a dark-gray color. Once again, that orange button provides good contrast. The
                        white text and images
                        show up very well against the dark background and the green is light enough that it also shows
                        up well against the dark gray.</p>
                    <p>There are basically five colors used; white, green, orange, dark gray and black. Although each
                        page is primarily one color,
                        they use enough of the colors from the other pages to keep the separate pages cohesive.</p><br>

                    children outdoors. Having a site where she can look for activities as well as check the weather
                    for that day will help her to know whether she needs to take jackets or hats and sunscreen.</p>
                    <br><br>

                <p><b>Social:</b>Molly is a very social person and loves to be involved in the community, and have

                <p><b>Technology:</b>Molly has a Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone with an unlimited data plan. She
                    does most of her internet searches and social media activities using her phone during the day or
                    when she is out of the house. She also has a laptop that she uses for her online schooling. She
                    uses it occasionally for internet searches and social media.</p>
                    <br><br>

                <p><b>Quote:</b><q>Being a mom is the most important job I can do at this time in mhy life. I want
                        to teach my boys everything they need to know about family life and life outside of the home
                        so that they can grow up to be strong, confident men who are good members of society.</q></p>

                <p><b>Quote:</b><q>I like working outside. It beats staying inside and having to wear a mask. When
                        I'm out there in the boonies all by myself, I can breathe the fresh air and think.</q></p>

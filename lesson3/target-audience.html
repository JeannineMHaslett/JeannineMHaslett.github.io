                <img class="molly" src="http://JeannineMHaslett.github.io/images/molly_profile.JPG" alt="photo of molly">

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Occupation: </b>Molly is a 29-year-old stay at home mom with three active boys.
                        She is always looking for activities that they can do during the week.

                    <li>
                        <b>Motivation for using the site: </b>When her husband is homoe on weekends, the family likes to
                        do things outdoors and they are always looking for community events to attend; whether it is a
                        rodeo, First-Responder meet-and-greet, a fishing derby, or anything else that will get the
                        children outdoors. Having a site where she can look for activities as well as check the weather
                        for that day will help her to know whether she needs to take jackets or hats and sunscreen.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Social :</b>Molly is a very social person and loves to be involved in the community, and have

                        does most of her internet searches and social media activities using her phone during the day or

                        uses it occasionally for internet searches and social media.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Quote: </b><q>Being a mom is the most important job I can do at this time in mhy life. I want
                            to teach my boys everything they need to know about family life and life outside of the home
                            so that they can grow up to be strong, confident men who are good members of society.</q>

                <li><b>Motivation for using the site: </b>Zack drives all over the state, so it may take 4 hours of

                    to take a coat and gloves or not, and he likes to check announcements and traffic so that he doesn't
                    end up getting caught in traffic jams for extended periods of time.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>Quote: </b><q>I like working outside. It beats staying inside and having to wear a mask. When
                        I'm out there in the boonies all by myself, I can breathe the fresh air and think.</q></li>

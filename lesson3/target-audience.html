            <img class="molly" src="images/molly_profile.JPG" alt="photo of molly">


            <p><b>Occupation: </b>Molly is a 29-year-old stay at home mom with three active boys.

            <p><b>Motivation for using the site: </b>When her husband is homoe on weekends, the family likes to
                do things outdoors and they are always looking for community events to attend; whether it is a
                rodeo, First-Responder meet-and-greet, a fishing derby, or anything else that will get the
                children outdoors. Having a site where she can look for activities as well as check the weather
                for that day will help her to know whether she needs to take jackets or hats and sunscreen.</p>

                her children involved in community events, as well. She is always looking for fun activities as

                does most of her internet searches and social media activities using her phone during the day or

                uses it occasionally for internet searches and social media.</p>


            <p><b>Quote: </b><q>Being a mom is the most important job I can do at this time in mhy life. I want
                    to teach my boys everything they need to know about family life and life outside of the home
                    so that they can grow up to be strong, confident men who are good members of society.</q></p>
